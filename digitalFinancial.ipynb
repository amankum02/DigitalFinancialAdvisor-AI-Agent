Agents Lab Notebook v1.0.0
This notebook contains steps and code to demonstrate the use of agents configured in Agent Lab in watsonx.ai. It introduces Python API commands for authentication using API key and invoking a LangGraph agent with a watsonx chat model.

Note: Notebook code generated using Agent Lab will execute successfully. If code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute. For details, see: Saving your work in Agent Lab as a notebook.

Some familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.11.

Notebook goals
The learning goals of this notebook are:

Defining a Python function for obtaining credentials from the IBM Cloud personal API key
Creating an agent with a set of tools using a specified model and parameters
Invoking the agent to generate a response
Setup

# import dependencies
from langchain_ibm import ChatWatsonx
from ibm_watsonx_ai import APIClient
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models.utils import Tool, Toolkit
import json
import requests
     
watsonx API connection
This cell defines the credentials required to work with watsonx API for Foundation Model inferencing.

Action: Provide the IBM Cloud personal API key. For details, see documentation.


import os
import getpass

def get_credentials():
	return {
		"url" : "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
		"apikey" : getpass.getpass("Please enter your api key (hit enter): ")
	}

def get_bearer_token():
    url = "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
    data = f"grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey={credentials['apikey']}"

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
    return response.json().get("access_token")

credentials = get_credentials()
     
Using the agent
These cells demonstrate how to create and invoke the agent with the selected models, tools, and parameters.

Defining the model id
We need to specify model id that will be used for inferencing:


model_id = "ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct"
     
Defining the model parameters
We need to provide a set of model parameters that will influence the result:


parameters = {
    "frequency_penalty": 0,
    "max_tokens": 2000,
    "presence_penalty": 0,
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 1
}
     
Defining the project id or space id
The API requires project id or space id that provides the context for the call. We will obtain the id from the project or space in which this notebook runs:


project_id = os.getenv("PROJECT_ID")
space_id = os.getenv("SPACE_ID")

     
Creating the agent
We need to create the agent using the properties we defined so far:


client = APIClient(credentials=credentials, project_id=project_id, space_id=space_id)

# Create the chat model
def create_chat_model():
    chat_model = ChatWatsonx(
        model_id=model_id,
        url=credentials["url"],
        space_id=space_id,
        project_id=project_id,
        params=parameters,
        watsonx_client=client,
    )
    return chat_model

- Use markdown syntax for formatting code snippets, links, JSON, tables, images, files.
- Any HTML tags must be wrapped in block quotes, for example ``````.
- When returning code blocks, specify language.
- Sometimes, things don't go as planned. Tools may not provide useful information on the first few tries. You should always try a few different approaches before declaring the problem unsolvable.
- When the tool doesn't give you what you were asking for, you must either use another tool or a different tool input.
- When using search engines, you try different formulations of the query, possibly even in a different language.
- You cannot do complex calculations, computations, or data manipulations without using tools.
- If you need to call a tool to compute something, always call it instead of saying you will call it.

If a tool returns an IMAGE in the result, you must include it in your answer as Markdown.

Example:

Tool result: IMAGE({commonApiUrl}/wx/v1-beta/utility_agent_tools/cache/images/plt-04e3c91ae04b47f8934a4e6b7d1fdc2c.png)
Markdown to return to user: ![Generated image]({commonApiUrl}/wx/v1-beta/utility_agent_tools/cache/images/plt-04e3c91ae04b47f8934a4e6b7d1fdc2c.png)

Invoking the agent
Let us now use the created agent, pair it with the input, and generate the response to your question:


agent = create_agent(context)

    converted_messages = []
    for message in messages:
        if (message["role"] == "user"):
            converted_messages.append(HumanMessage(content=message["content"]))
        elif (message["role"] == "assistant"):
            converted_messages.append(AIMessage(content=message["content"]))
    return converted_messages

question = input("Question: ")

messages = [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": question
}]

generated_response = agent.invoke(
    { "messages": convert_messages(messages) },
    { "configurable": { "thread_id": "42" } }
)

print_full_response = False

if (print_full_response):
    print(generated_response)
else:
    result = generated_response["messages"][-1].content
    print(f"Agent: {result}")
